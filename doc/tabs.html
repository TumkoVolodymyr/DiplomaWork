<h3>The Color Code of the Project Specification Dialog</h3>
<P>
The six tabs of the dialog have different colours. If further dialogs are 
opened concerening the matter of a tab the same colour for this dialog is used. 
This way a connection to the  different steps of creating a classifier is given.
The topics of the tabs and the assigned colours are:

<P>
The project specification dialog has to be closed before other dialogs or 
the main menu is enabled again (except the dialogs invoked from one of the tabs). 
This may sometimes be uncomfortable but it helps to do a consistency check of 
the parameters. If some settings are not valid the dialog cannot be closed and 
the user has to look for the problem. This way inconsistent projects are avoided.

        Another possibility to load a data file is to choose

<!--------------------The training data file------------->

<h3>The Training Data File</h3>

The data file is the only file you must edit. NEFCLASS-J needs some 
informations to initialize the classifier. These initial values with the 
corresponding keywords must be written on the top of the pattern file. 
A NEFCLASS data file consists of two to five blocks. Comments are 
allowed between the blocks as well as line feeds or any kind of whitespace. 
Every line of comment has to begin with %, # or //. 
The blocks have the following structure:
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>The first line of a block is the keyword, i.e. this word is the 
        only word in this line. Keyword are written in capital letters.
    </TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>The following lines contain the corresponding data.
    </TD>
  </TR>

 <TR>
   <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
   </TD>
   <TD>Some blocks need a keyword for the end of data.
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

There is a mandatory first block and a mandatory last block. The other blocks 
are optional and because of the use of kewords there is no need to stick to a 
sequence. The blocks are described now in detail.
<P>
<B>Mandatory blocks:</B>
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>DIMENSIONS<BR>
	DIMENSIONS has to be the first block in the file. The next line 
        consists of two integer values. The first gives the number of 
        independent variables that means input values, the second gives 
        the number of dependant variables that means the number of classes. 
        If no class information is given this value must be set to ‘0'.
    </TD>
  </TR>

 <TR>
   <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
   </TD>
   <TD> PATTERNS<BR>
	PATTERNS has to be the last block in the file.The line following the 
        keyword consist of one integer value. This is the number of patterns.
        In the following lines the patterns are listed one pattern per line. 
	 <B>-</B> the values can be separated by any whitespace.<BR>
	 <B>-</B> the values for the input variables may be real or integer<BR>
	 <B>-</B> the classes must be coded as a real vector from [0, 1]^m 
          (m is the number of classes). The class of the pattern is determined 
          by the largest value. Usually each pattern belongs only to one class. 
          Therefore all components except one are set to 0 and the one indicating 
          the class is set to 1. For example, if there are 4 classes then class 2
          will be encoded as 0 1 0 0.<BR>
	<B>-</B>  this block can be finished with the keyword END. This is meant for 
           data files used by NEFCLASS-PC. So files containing this keyword 
           need not to be changed.
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>

<B>Optional blocks:</B>
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>Block for a data file description:<BR>
        NAME<BR>
	With using NAME only one line of description can follow in the next line. 
       This command is used in data files used by NEFCLASS-PC. These files need 
       not to be changed.<BR>
       or<BR>
       	STARTNAME / ENDNAME<BR>
	The first line of this block is the keyword STARTNAME. The description
        follows in the next lines. The block has to be finished with the keyword 
        ENDNAME.
    </TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>VARNAMES<BR>
	In the lines following this keyword the variable names can be set. 
        It might be easier to use NEFCLASS-J for this. When a data file is 
        loaded default names are given to the input variables and the classes.
        If you open the 'Project Specification' dialog and select the <I>Data</I> 
        tab you will find a button 'Edit Labels'. Using this an editor is 
        invoked where you can change the names. It has the advantage that 
        you can change only some names. For the others the default names 
        will be saved. If you write the names directly to the file, you have 
        to name all variables and classes.
    </TD>
  </TR>

 <TR>
   <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=7>
   </TD>
   <TD>	INRANGES<BR>
	Here the ranges for each input variable can be specified. The exact
       ranges are computed during the patterns are loaded but here you can 
       specify larger ranges for the patterns.

    <TD><B>Number and Type of Fuzzy Sets</B><BR>
        For each variable a number of fuzzy sets (a fuzzy partitioning) has to 
        be defined. By default three fuzzy sets are defined which automatically 
        get names. The membership functions are equally distributed on the domain
        of the respective input feature. There are three types that can be 
        selected (triangular, trapezoidal and bell-shaped). As default the 
        triangular membership function is used where the leftmost and rightmost
        functions are shouldered. You have the following options:
	<TABLE>
   	 <TR>
    	  <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=6>

 		If you select this item a <a href="partitionfs.html">dialog</a>

    <TD><B>The Aggregation Function</B><BR>
		Let us use the network view of the classifer for this explanation. 
		Many rule units (hidden layer) can be connected to one class unit 
		(output layer), i.e. many rules can have the same class in their 
		consequent. The output of a rule unit is a degree of fulfilment. 
		The rule units send their outputs to the class units. The 
		aggregation function of a class unit (netu) calculates a value
		 from the output values of the rule units that will be the output 
		of the class unit.

   <TD><B>Interpretation of Classification Result</B><BR>
		The output values of the class units calculated by the 
		aggregation function need  not to give a clear classification 
		decision if the propagated pattern belongs to a class. A crisp
		output would be a vector where all components are '0' exept of one 
		with '1'. Normally you will get a vector where all components have 
		real values from [0,1]. The question is now how this can be 
		interpreted. Up to now only one interpretation strategy is 
		implemented.

With the button on the right the <a href="ruleedit.html">rule editor</A> dialog is
invoked. Here the yellow (classifier) color instead of orange (rules) is chosen
because this dialog is used to insert pior knowledge or editing the rule base. 
After this the rulebase had to be learned again. So these rules can be seen
as parameters set before the learning process of the classifier is started. <P>
