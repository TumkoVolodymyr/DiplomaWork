<h3>NEFCLASS-J: The Tool</h3>
<P>
<P>
NEFCLASS-J is an interactive simulation software tool to develop a 
<a href="#classifier">neuro-fuzzy classifier</a> from a given 
<a href="#data">data file</a>. 
There are several other methods which are able to do this but the focus of 
the NEFCLASS model lies in the interpretability of the developed classifier. 
The constraints of the learning algorithm allow the user to interactively 
influence the training process. 
<P>
So the main goal of NEFCLASS is to help the user to create a readable classifier 
that also provides an acceptable accuracy. However, the user has to be aware, 
that readability and accuracy do not go together. An interpretable fuzzy 
system should display the following features:
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>few meaningful rules with few variables in their antecedents,
    </TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>few meaningful sets for each variable,
    </TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>there are no rule weights,
    </TD>
  </TR>

 <TR>
   <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
   </TD>
   <TD>	identical linguistic terms are represented by identical fuzzy sets,
   </TD>
  </TR>

<TR>
   <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
   </TD>
   <TD>only normal fuzzy sets are used, or even better fuzzy numbers 
       or fuzzy intervals.
   </TD>
  </TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
NEFCLASS-J implements a neuro-fuzzy model
based on a generic 3-layer fuzzy perceptron. It is a further development of 
NEFCLASS-PC but there are some more features and the graphic interface 
changed completely. It is adapted now to the graphic interfaces of Windows 
and Unix X-Terminals. In order to get a platform independent NEFCLASS-Tool 
the programing language is Java. So every computer using an operating 
system that supports a java interpreter is convenient.

<h3>NEFCLASS-J: The Philosophy</h3>
<P>

The handling of the created NEFCLASS system is organized in projects.
Whenever a stage of development is reached that should be saved, this can 
be done as a project. For the creation of a classifier the following steps 
have to be done:
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD>Parameters to define and constrain the classifiers have to be set. 
        Some of them (e.g. learning rate, aggregation function, stop control, 
        learning procedure) can be set without  a data file to be opened. 
        Others like number and type of fuzzy sets depend on the patterns. 
        So the next step is to
    </TD>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>

           </TD>

          </TD>
         </TR>
      </TABLE>	
   </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

In every state it is possible to save the project. If a data file is loaded 
the file name is saved in the project so that it will be loaded automatically 
when the project is opened again. So be careful with moving your data files. 
If the classifier is just created additional to the project file a classifier 
file is saved. The project file is supposed to have the extension ‘.prj'. 
It contains the parameter definitions used to create the classifier. The 
classifier file is supposed to have the extension ‘.cls'. It contains the 
rule base and all other informations to describe the classifier. The user only 
needs to save the project and the files will be created automatically. These 
files are in ASCII code and can be viewed with any editor. It is possible to 
handle one project at a time only. So a project has to be closed before another 
one can be opened.
<P>
Furthermore it is possible to load a second data file which can used for testing 
the network or even classifying unknown data. It can be loaded by 
‘Project|Open Application Data'. Although it is sortet into the Project menu 
it is not neatly connected to it. Another project can be loaded to classifiy 
this data. It is not saved with any project as it is done with the training data. 
<P>
The data files cannot be closed explicitely. They are simply replaced when a 
new file is loaded. NEFCLASS will do a consistency check if the new data file 
fits the classifier. If not a message is given that the project must be closed
 and a new one has to be created. With closing the project the data files are 
also closed.
<P>
The handling of a project is controlled by the
<a href=#projectdialog>Project Specification Dialog</a> which is opend when one of
the following main menu entries is selected:

<h3>Pruning the Rule Base</h3>
<P>
Pruning the rule base is used to improve the interpretability of the classifier. 
Pruning tries to get the same or a better classification results with a smaller 
rule base. There are three options to prune the rule base:
<p>
<TABLE>
  <TR>
    <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_mint.gif" HEIGHT=7>
    </TD>
    <TD><B>Manual Pruning</B>
        <br>
	For this open the <A href="ruleedit.html" target="_new">rule editor</a>. Every line for
       a rule has a number and the performance of the rule in the beginning.
       Use the values for the performance to find out which are the good rules. 
       Then you have two possibilities:
      <TABLE>
       <TR>
        <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=6>
        </TD>
        <TD>use the 'good rules as prior knowledge'<BR>
	   - erase the rules with the smallest performance values<BR>
	   - set the ‘number of rules' parameter the same as rules are specified 
             now, <BR>
	   - set the ‘relearn the rulebase' option and<BR> 
	   - create the classifier again. <BR>
	   Think about resetting the fuzzy sets before 
          (this need not to be done but you can try it).
        </TD>
      </TR>

      <TR>
       <TD valign="top"><img alt="" src="images/p_grau.gif" HEIGHT=6>
       </TD>
       <TD>create a completely new rule base<BR>
	   - count the 'good rules',<BR>
	   - remove all rules,<BR>
	   - set the 'number of rules' parameter to the value you counted,<BR>
	   - reset the fuzzy sets,<BR>
	   - create the classifier.
       </TD>
      </TR>
     </TABLE>
     If this process was not successful you can get the old rulebase by using 
     'Rules|Restore Rule Base'. But remember that only the last rule base can be 
     restored. If you do this manual pruning process several times you have to 
     save the former classifier under a new project name. Please remember further 
     that you might have changed the fuzzy sets. The  item 
     'Classifier|Restore Fuzzy Sets' of the main menu will restore the state 
     before the  last step.
     <p>
    With this you only can erase rules. Methods which also reduces the number 
    of variables  in a rule are used in the pruning option described next.

        <B>Automatic Pruning</B>
        <br>
	Please note that the old rule base can be restored after the pruning 
        process. But just in case it may be better to save the classifier under 
        a new project name before starting to prune.
        <BR>
	There are <a href="#pruningmethods">four methods</a> that are implemented 
        for automatical pruning. These methods are automatically used one
        after the other. After a method is used the fuzzy sets are trained. 
        For this the selected validation mode is used. If the resulting classifier
        produces a smaller number of misclassifications or a smaller error value 
        than the former one, this new one is taken to be improved with the next 
        pruning method. During this process all parameters you specified, except 
        these concerning the rulebase, are used.

<H3>Pruning Methods</H3>
<P>
The learning algorithm of the NEFCLASS model provides good results for many 
classification problems. However, a good interpretation of the learning result 
cannot always be guaranteed, especially for high-dimensional problems. Because 
interpretation is one reason for using a fuzzy classifier in the first place, 
there is a need to enhance the learning algorithms of a neuro-fuzzy system with 
techniques for simplifying the obtained result [Nauck/Kruse 97]. Four pruning 
strategies are used to improve the interpretability of the classifier.

    <TD>A variable is not important for the classification.
        <P>
	The task is to find out if there is an input variable that is not 
        necessary for the classification. For this the correlations of the input
        variables with the class information is used. Variables that have a low 
        correlation are tested whether they can be deleted from the antecedet or 
        not. Under a statistical view it is dubious to use the correlation, but 
        it is only used to find out a sequence of testing the variables and is not
        used to delete a variable. 
	<P>
       The variable with the lowest correlation is the first to be tested. It is 
       deleted from the antecedents of all rules, a consistency check of the rule
       base follows and the fuzzy sets are trained. If this improves the 
       classification result this classifier is taken as the current one and the
       next variable with the lowest correlation is tested. If a test fails and 
       no improvement was reached the last classifier that improved the 
       classification result is the outcome of this pruning method.

        A variable is not important for the degree of fulfilment of a rule.
        <P>
	For each rule the linguistic term is identified whose membership degree
       is identical to the degree of fulfilment of the rule in the least number 
       of cases. The rule with the smallest number is selected and the identified
       term is removed from its antecedent, and a consistency check is done. 
       After this the fuzzy sets are trained and if the classifer can be 
       improved it is kept and this pruning step is repeated. If the classifier 
       cannot be improved the previous one is restored. The last classifier that
       improved the classification result is the outcome of this pruning method.

        A term uses fuzzy set with a very large support
        <P>
	If a variable is partitioned by more than two fuzzy sets, sometimes 
        the support for one or more of them can become quite large during
        learning. This can be seen as evidence, that such a fuzzy set is 
        superfluous. 
	<P>
       The fuzzy sets of every variable are sorted by their width. The term
       with the widest fuzzy set of all is deleted from all rules. Only in 
       rules where it is the last term of the antecedent it is not deleted.
       A consistency check of the rule base follows and the fuzzy sets are 
       trained. If this improves the classification result this classifier is 
       taken as the current one and the fuzzy set with the next biggest width 
       is examined. This process stops when the classification result is not 
       improved anymore. The last classifier that improved the classification 
       result is the outcome of this pruning method.

    <TD>All patterns are presented to the rules. For every rule it is counted
        how often the classification is correct and it produces the maximum 
        degree of fulfilment for the correct class. The rule with the smallest
        number is deleted and the fuzzy sets are trained. If this improves the 
        classification result this classifier is taken as the current one and 
        the rule with the next lowest number is deleted. This process stops when
        a test fails and no improvement was reached or if no rule can be deleted 
        because there is only one for each class. The last improved classifier
       is the result of this pruning method.
