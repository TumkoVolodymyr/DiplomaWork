Training data: F:\Users\Volodymyr\Documents\NetBeansProjects\DiplomaWork\TemplateOutAll.dat
Training for at most 100 cycles and for at least 0 cycles.
Continue for 10 cycles after a local optimum was found.
Learning will stop at 0 misclassifications.
50% of the data are used for single validation (test validation mode)
Parameter: LearningRate = 0.01, Fuzzy set constraints: 
keep order, must overlap, 
rule weights are not used.
The rule base will consist of 10 rules using the best 5 rules for each class.
Each variable uses 3 Треугольная fuzzy sets.
Fuzzy set learning will not be invoked.

Starting the training process using 100.0% of all cases.
Searching for rules in the training data...

0 possible rules found. Now determine the optimal consequents.


Performances of Rule Candidates per Class

Selection of consequents is complete.
Writing the rules to the log file, please wait.


0 rules found in the data:


Best per class rule learning: selecting the best 5 rules for each class.
Best rules per class selected, trimming the rule base.
Rule base with 0 rules created.

This rule base covers all patterns.
Performance on training data (100.0% of all cases):
0 patterns, 0 misclassifications (error = 0.000000)
